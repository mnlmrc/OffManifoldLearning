This repository contains the code to implement a novel rehabilitation approach for motor impairments after stroke, 
inspired by previous work by [Sadtler et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13665). Patients are initially 
assessed by measuring finger enslaving patterns during isometric finger presses toward different directions similar to 
the procedure used by [Xu et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.29.555444v1). This allows us to 
establish the residual control space that the patient is able to explore (i.e., the intrinsic manifold). During the 
subsequent rehabilitation, patients are asked to control a screen cursor through multifinger isometric force patterns. 
The force patterns generated by the patients are mapped onto the cursor velocity through a linear decoder. Initially,
the decoder requires that the force patterns remains within the intrinsic manifold. Subsequently, the mapping is 
gradually rotated to encourage the patient to explore portion of the control space outside the intrinsic manifold by 
generating force patterns outside their initial repertoire.
